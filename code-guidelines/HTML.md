# HTML

Inspired by [Codeguide](http://codeguide.co/)

## Syntax

- Use [Dotfiles](https://github.com/Netural/frontend-resources/blob/master/dotfiles/README.md)
- Nested elements should be indented once
- Always use double quotes, never single quotes, on attributes
- Don't include a trailing slash in self-closing elements—the HTML5 spec says they're optional.
- Don't omit optional closing tags (e.g. `</li>` or `</body>`)
- Use the HTML5 doctype `<!DOCTYPE html>` 

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <img src="images/company-logo.png" alt="Company">
    <h1 class="hello-world">Hello, world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
## Language attribute

From the [HTML5 spec](http://w3c.github.io/html/semantics.html#the-html-element)

> Authors are encouraged to specify a lang attribute on the root html element, giving the document’s language. This aids speech synthesis tools to determine what pronunciations to use, translation tools to determine what rules to use, and so forth.

Head to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) for language codes.

```HTML
<html lang="en-us">
  <!-- ... -->
</html>
```

## IE compatibility mode

Internet Explorer supports the use of a document compatibility `<meta>` tag to specify what version of IE the page should be rendered as. Unless circumstances require otherwise, it's most useful to instruct IE to use the latest supported mode with edge mode.

For more information, read this [awesome Stack Overflow article](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6771258/what-does-meta-http-equiv-x-ua-compatible-content-ie-edge-do).

```HTML
<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=Edge">
```

## Character encoding

Quickly and easily ensure proper rendering of your content by declaring an explicit character encoding. When doing so, you may avoid using character entities in your HTML, provided their encoding matches that of the document (generally UTF-8).

```HTML
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
```

## CSS and JavaScript includes

Per HTML5 spec, typically there is no need to specify a `type` when including CSS and JavaScript files as `text/css` and `text/javascript` are their respective defaults.

```HTML
<!-- External CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="code-guide.css">

<!-- In-document CSS -->
<style>
  /* ... */
</style>

<!-- JavaScript -->
<script src="code-guide.js"></script>
```

### Location of includes

- Consider a above-the-fold CSS file
- *Always* include JavaScript files on the bottom of a page. 
- We try to streamline the including as good as possible in the boilerplates

## Boolean attributes

A boolean attribute is one that needs no declared value. XHTML required you to declare a value, but HTML5 has no such requirement.
For further reading, consult the WhatWG section on boolean attributes:

> The presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the true value, and the absence of the attribute represents the false value.

If you *must* include the attribute's value, and **you don't need** to, follow this WhatWG guideline:

> If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string or [...] the attribute's canonical name, with no leading or trailing whitespace.

**In short, don't add a value.**


```HTML
<input type="text" disabled>

<input type="checkbox" value="1" checked>

<select>
  <option value="1" selected>1</option>
</select>
```

## Reduce markup

Whenever possible, avoid superfluous parent elements when writing HTML. Many times this requires iteration and refactoring, but produces less HTML.
```HTML 
<!-- Not so great -->
<span class="avatar">
  <img src="...">
</span>

<!-- Better -->
<img class="avatar" src="...">
```

## JavaScript generated markup

Writing markup in a JavaScript file makes the content harder to find, harder to edit, and less performant. Avoid it whenever possible. Use serverside rendering or if not possible at least choose a JS templating library ([Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) preferred).
