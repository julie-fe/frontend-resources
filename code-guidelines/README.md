## General
- Use [Dotfiles](https://github.com/Netural/frontend-resources/blob/master/dotfiles/README.md)
- Document code!
- **Mobile first.** Sketch on a dense wireframe. Limited space helps to focus on the important parts. Remember that mobile users are very *goal oriented* and want to finish a task. Don't assume that mobile users want less content than on desktop just because of limited space.
- **Embrace Progressive Enhancement.** Start off with no CSS (or as less as possible) and imagine how your markup will look like without additional styles (helps to get the HTML structure right). Then add CSS according to our [CSS guides](https://github.com/Netural/frontend-resources/blob/master/code-guidelines/CSS.md). Finally add [JS functionality](https://github.com/Netural/frontend-resources/blob/master/code-guidelines/JS.md).

## Tips
- **Get a pen & paper!**
- **Think & draw before you code.** If you want to code a functionality/module/design, excerpt the subparts of it and find the correct HTML elements for them. [Divide and conquer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule).
- **Consider existing HTML and CSS.** Maybe similar functionality or parts of it already exist! Take a short while to explore existing solutions within the project and ask questions, questions, questions.
- If your file is huge, you are doing something wrong.
